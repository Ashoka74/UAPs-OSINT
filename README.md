# UAPs-OSINT

This is a collection of resources and ideas to kick-start an Open-Source Intelligence movement on Unidentified Aerial Phenomenons (UAPs).

## Tasks

### 1) Social Media Insights

- Collect UAP sightings across social media platforms
- Validate UAP sightings using tools such as Instagram location to match similar images within an area and rule out insects, birds, and camera artifacts
- Generate Knowledge Graphs of actors interacting within the UAP community
- Generate Statistics and NLP analyses on UAP sightings

### 2) Hypothesis testing

- UAPs can disrupt the local magnetic field and leave a recognizable signature
  - Leverage Swarm Satellites to get 24h measure of local geomagnetic variations during a UAP sighting
  - Normalize and align all time-series
  - Fit a linear regression model
